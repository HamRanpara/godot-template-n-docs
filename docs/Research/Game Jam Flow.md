"Constraints are the designer's best friend; they provide challenge and provocation, just as rules provide players with a framework to play and innovate within"

## **Modular framework**

1. Ideation - Create generative constraints, identify one idea
2. Prototyping - How to build a paper prototype in the first few hours of the jam and use the remaining time iterating and refining your core concept. One of the most important techniques for all designers. 
3. Playtesting I - To understand the dynamics of the game, you need to playtest it. Key to playtesting is early and often. It is to **find the fun** and prioritize design decisions so that the project stays within the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">scope of something you can actually make</mark> and something people actually want to play. 
4. Prioritizing - Figure out the most important aspect of the game and building from that, slashing **everything else**. One of the most painful endeavors even for the most experienced designers. It is also a secret to the success and failure of most games. 
5. Production - All elements come together, where skills come into play. 
6. Playtesting II - Playtesting game while in production serves several functions - see whether technology is working before you build too much, helps you find bugs and it keeps you honest. Proof of a game is not in its graphics, code, or concept, but in its playtest. 
7. Show and Tell - Collective introspection

Game jams are best mastered through practice. 'Just do it'.

## **Before Your jam**

1. **Goals**. Whether you are motivated to build community, learn game design, or engage with content, goals change specifics. Goals affect time allocation, space, and materials.
2. **Audience**. Think about motivation for participation, look at participating audience of your team, and explain to those that need help understanding what needs to be understood for the jam. In other words, some rule setting or environment clarity. 
3. **Space**. Reserve space for the jam that best maximizes the process. Game jams are best done apart from day-to-day work. Consider moving off-site, or rearranging the site. 
4. **Materials**. Consider the materials that best meet your goals of design time. For digital jams, consider internet access, prepared documentation.

Great learning can happen through prototyping.
You can prototype a game in a **couple of hours**. 
Learner reflection **during a game jam** is potent and worthwhile. 
Learner reflection **after a game jam** has remarkable staying- power.
